Before implementing these steps, it’s essential to have a conversation with your children about how everyone in the family will work together to speak respectfully in the home.\n\n\t1.\tCalmly Ask for a Do-Over: If your child speaks rudely, calmly and kindly say, “Let’s try that again, please,” giving them the opportunity to rephrase their words in a respectful way.\n\n\t2.\tDisengage If Rudeness Continues: If your child persists in speaking disrespectfully, let them know you won’t engage with them until they speak kindly. Continue with what you were doing without reacting to their behavior.\n\n\n\nIn your initial conversation, explain to your child that if you ignore them when they speak disrespectfully, it’s not because you don’t want to listen—it’s because everyone in the home deserves to be spoken to with kindness and respect. Make it clear that you’re always excited to hear what they have to say, but the conversation must happen respectfully. Let them know that speaking kindly is the key to getting your attention and fostering a positive, cooperative family environment.\n\n\n\nBy setting this boundary and sticking to it, you’re teaching your child valuable communication skills and reinforcing the importance of mutual respect.\n"

Use simple instructions and avoid overwhelming them.\r\nAuthority in Parenting: Be the leader, not their friend. Offer choices within limits, and use consistency and clear boundaries.\r\nInstilling Gratitude and Kindness: Teach children to appreciate what they have, encourage them to be kind, and lead by example.\r\nDealing with Lying and Backtalk: Understand why kids lie or talk back and address the root cause (often independence or attention-seeking).\r\nFun & Learning\r\n\r\nImportance of Play: Play is not just fun but also a learning tool for toddlers. It develops cognitive and social skills.\r\nReading and Language: Encourage reading to build language skills.\r\nSocial Life: Help your child understand the world outside their home by fostering friendships and group play.\r\nBuilding Character: Teach life skills like honesty, responsibility, and empathy early on to build a strong moral foundation.\r\nBehavior & Responsibility\r\n\r\nConsistency in Parenting: Be consistent with rules and consequences to instill a sense of security and order.\r\nEmpowerment & Independence: Encourage your toddler to do things independently to boost their self-confidence and problem-solving skills.\r\nBoundaries and Routines: Routines help children feel safe.
